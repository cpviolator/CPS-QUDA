This folder contains 8 variants (2x2x2 options) of a CPS simulation of 1 pion on
a lattice. The options are specified in the filenames.

Naming conventions--

CPU/GPU 
CPU- run code on CPU as normal. Depends on the scalar version of CPS.
GPU- run code on GPU. Depends on the GPU version of CPS, QUDA, and CUDA. This is
much, much faster. If you have multiple GPUs connected, only one can be used
(specified in a runtime argument, see below).

mom/ps 
mom- Momentum source.  
ps- Point source.

QU/UNQ 
QU- Quenched simulation.  
UNQ- Unquenched simulation.

Arguments-- 

./1pion.[run location].[source].[quenching].exe [random seed] [GPU index] 
(ex. ./1pion.CPU.mom.QU.exe 1234; ./1pion.GPU.mom.QU.exe 1234 0)

The seed is used to initialize CPS's RNG. Running an executable with the same
seed twice will produce identical data. It is an int of typically 4+ digits.

If you have one GPU, it has index 0. Check your GPU placements with:
$ nvidia-smi
This code can only run on one GPU at a time.

Usage--

First, set the necessary parameters (Beta, lattice size, etc.) in params.h.
Then, if this is the first time you are using these parameters in that file,
comment out READ or set it to != 1. CPS will generate a lattice object at each
timestep and store it in a .dat file in /latt_configs. Otherwise, set READ to 1
and the .dat files will be read instead of re-generated (this runs significantly
faster). The seed does not affect the lattice object, e.g. a file created by
`./1pion.CPU.mom.QU.exe 1234` can be read by `./1pion.CPU.mom.QU.exe 6666`
provided the parameters are not changed.

The physics is done on each lattice object just after it is generated/read- for
details, see the commented source code. The data is written to a .dat file in 
/data whose name contains the simulation parameters and seed. It can then be 
manipulated with the code in /src/analysis or your own statistics tools.

Each line of outputted data is of the form
[step] [t] 0 [C(t)]
Where C(t) is the correlation function, the sum of Re Tr(M Mdag) over all 
lattice sites, with M an inverse Wilson fermion matrix. '0' is shorthand
for 'projected onto the 0 momentum mode'.
