This code is useful for quickly comparing results bewteen your CPU
and GPU builds of CPS.

To use it, edit the makefile so that it knows where your
CPS, QUDA, and CUDA builds are. The first time you run the code,
a small lattice will be generated. On subsequent test runs,
uncomment the line `#define READ` and the code will read in that
lattice.
